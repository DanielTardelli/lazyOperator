## Notes
Just a reminder section for myself

- Need cycle detection in controller logic to prevent against never ending loop of resource provisioning
- Note issue with referencing array elements, its not supported
- Need to do spec validation checks in the definition before the args are propagated to relationships
- REMEMBER ARGOCD SOURCE IS GIT, IF YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL TEMPLATES YOU NEED TO PUSH TO THE GIT SOURCE
